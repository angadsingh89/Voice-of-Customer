## 🚀 Overview
**Voice of Customer** is an AI-powered dashboard designed for Product Managers to instantly quantify and visualize unstructured user feedback. 

Instead of manually reading thousands of support tickets, tweets, or app reviews, this tool uses natural language processing (NLP) to:
1.   **Analyze Sentiment**: Determine if feedback is Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
2.  **Cluster Themes**: Automatically group feedback into actionable categories (e.g., "Pricing", "UX", "Performance", "Bugs").
3.  **Generate Insights**: Provide an executive summary of the top product issues.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Product Managers struggle to aggregate qualitative data from varied sources. Manual tagging is slow and biased. This tool automates the "Discovery" phase of the product lifecycle, allowing PMs to focus on "Execution."

## 🛠️ Technologies
-   **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS (Custom Design System)
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
-   **AI/NLP Logic**: Sentiment.js, Keyword Clustering (Custom implementation)
-   **Deployment**: Vercel

## ✨ Key Features
-   **Real-time Analysis**: Paste any text and get instant results.
-   **Glassmorphism UI**: Premium, dark-mode accessible design.
-   **Interactive Charts**: drill-down into sentiment distribution.
-   **Zero-API Cost**: Optimized to run client-side without expensive LLM API keys.
